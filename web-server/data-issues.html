Well the new MSC service worked great for a few days and is now dead.  Waiting again for MSC / ECCC to fix the data availability issues -- Andrew<br><br>

I switched over to the MSC alternative download service, though this morning's run will be late.  There may be some residual bugs to work out -- Andrew<br><br>

I started experimenting with the new MSC alternative download service, but haven't finished getting it working yet.  I'm still hoping MSC can somehow fix their baseline service. --Andrew

MSC / ECCC are having trouble serving the data we use to generate the windmaps and the windgrams.  They have put up an alternative service I may be able to use to get the data.  I will be working on switching over to this on 8 or 9 April 2019.  Sorry for the delays and missing data. --Andrew
